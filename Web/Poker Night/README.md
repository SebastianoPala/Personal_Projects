This project involved the design and development of a full-stack, multi-player online poker website. The platform enables users to engage in poker games either in single-player mode against the CPU or in multi-player sessions with other users.

FEATURES:

Dynamic Gameroom System: Users can create custom gamerooms. Each room is assigned a unique identifier and can be configured as:

Public: Listed in a public lobby for any user to join seamlessly.

Private: Accessible only to users who possess the unique room ID, facilitating games among friends and private groups.

Flexible Play Modes:

Multiplayer: Real-time, synchronous poker games in user-created gamerooms.

Single Player: users can play against simple CPU-controlled opponents. Wins/losses within this mode are isolated and do not affect the user's core account balance.

User Profile Customization: The platform allows the user to upload and display a custom avatar.

Technical Implementation:

The application was built utilizing XAMPP as the local development environment. MySQL was employed as the relational database management system for handling user data, game states, and room information.
