The project consists of a website that allows users to play poker online, both alone or with friends.

Players can create Gamerooms which can be either public or private. Each room has a unique id, and players can join other rooms if they know the id of a certain room. Public rooms are also shown in the main menu, and players can join them with a click.

Players can also play by themselves in the single player rooms against the CPU. Money won/lost during these games won't be saved to the database.

Each player can customize their profile picture

It was made using XAMPP and MYSQL as the web server and database, respectively.
