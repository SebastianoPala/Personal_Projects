Developed a custom C++ implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher that significantly extends the classic algorithm. The program features a multi-phase encryption process, splitting the key into three distinct parts for sequential application. It incorporates a columnar transposition step based on a custom sorting permutation of the key and includes a unique key-shuffling mechanism to increase resistance to frequency analysis. The tool includes a full menu-driven console interface for managing keys, messages, and ciphertexts via local file storage.
