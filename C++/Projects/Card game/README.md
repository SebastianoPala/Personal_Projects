This is a simple C++ program I made to learn various constructs of the standard library.
Its a multi-threaded card game simulation where players compete in a series of rounds. The architecture uses producer-consumer patterns with mutexes and condition variables to synchronize player threads with a central dealer thread. Players draw cards, place bets based on their hand, and attempt to play cards closest to a target card drawn by the dealer. The system features file-based player initialization, automatic money management, and handles player elimination when they run out of money. The program supports both interactive and automatic modes for round progression.
